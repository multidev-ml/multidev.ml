          <p>It's mostly about me.... it's only maintained by one person.&nbsp;
          <br><br>
          OK, me … not much to talk about … just a lonely guy doing some code and learning new stuff… so … About the site ….&nbsp;
          <br><br>The intention of this site it's to give you some tools to make your day easier, I had the idea of creating a “Tools Page” months ago until i really started to make it. The truth only started to make it 3 days ago ....&nbsp;
          <br><br>I started to read about static pages and static page generator tools and ... why not ! It's a new thing , I have the idea why not implement it this way. This is not a pioneer idea, the web it's full of "tool pages", this is one more in the list, but ...&nbsp;
          <br><br>I would be happy if give us (me) suggestions of scripts to make, bugs, design, etc .... For that you have "Give suggestion" button in the top left side of the page, you don't need to identify yourself but if you do and want I'll credit you in the script idea or correction.&nbsp;
          <br><br>Anyway I hope you feel at home, be happy and healthy ;) </p>
